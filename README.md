## Special Thanks

## Compiling

## Notes
This save editor supports any version of New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

Save files are region-specific, however Penguin will allow you to easily change between them.

The information in this editor is based purely on existing documentation (linked above). As such, if something doesn't happen in-game when you expect it to, it's probably the game's fault.
